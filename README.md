# 🚀 Movie_Review_Analysis 👍 👎 ⚖️

The objective of this project is to perform sentiment analysis on text data. Given a sentence, the project classifies whether the sentence expresses positive or negative sentiment. Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) task used to understand the emotional tone of text, making it valuable in various applications such as customer reviews, social media analysis, and more.

## About 📚
🎓 Capstone Project - Data Analytics Program with [Azubi Africa](https://www.azubiafrica.org/data-analytics)
This project is the culmination of a 9-month Data Analytics program with Azubi Africa. It aims to analyze movie reviews and classify them into one of three sentiment categories: positive, negative, or neutral. Leveraging Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, it provides sentiment predictions for movie reviews.

## Preview 👁️


## Notable Features 🌟

- **Data Collection:** Gathered a balanced dataset of movie reviews with sentiment labels.

- **EDA:** Conducted comprehensive exploratory data analysis to gain insights.

- **Data Preprocessing:** Leveraged NLP tools to clean and prepare text data for modeling.

- **Model Training:** Trained various machine learning models for sentiment classification.

- **Model Evaluation:** Assessed model performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and more.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimized models using grid search and cross-validation.

- **App Deployment:** Deployed a user-friendly sentiment analysis app on Gradio.

- **Docker Containerization:** Containerized the app for easy distribution and deployment.


## Setup 🛠️
To set up and run the project:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone '<https://github.com/yourusername/movie-sentiment-analysis.git>'
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd movie-sentiment-analysis
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:

   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
5. **Install project dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
6. Explore the Jupyter notebooks for data analysis, model training, and experimentation.

7. Run the Gradio app for real-time sentiment analysis:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage 🚀

1. **Launch the Gradio App:** Start the Gradio app by running `python app.py`.

2. **Analyze Reviews:** Input movie reviews to receive real-time sentiment predictions.

3. **Customize and Experiment:** Modify hyperparameters, customize the pipeline, or fine-tune models to suit your needs.
